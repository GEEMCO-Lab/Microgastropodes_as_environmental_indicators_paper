# Figures

This directory contains all figures generated by the analysis scripts.

## Automated Figure Generation

```r
source("scripts/04_create_figures.R")
```

Or as part of the complete analysis:
```r
source("scripts/run_all.R")
```

2. **fig2_richness_temperature.png** - Species richness vs environmental temperature
3. **fig3_ordination.png** - NMDS ordination of microgastropod communities
4. **fig4_correlation_heatmap.png** - Correlation matrix of diversity and environment
5. **fig5_combined_results.png** - Multi-panel summary figure
